# Wine Quality Prediction 

This project uses multiple machine learning models to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical features. The models used include **RandomForest Classifier**, **MLP Classifier**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **SVC**, **SGD Classifier**, and **Logistic Regression**.

## Project Description 
This project predicts wine quality based on chemical features such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content. The quality is categorized as **good** or **bad**. Various machine learning models are trained and compared to identify the best-performing model.

## Features 
- Predicts wine quality using six different machine learning classifiers.
- Compares the performance of each classifier.
- Outputs accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
