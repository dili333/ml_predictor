Wine Quality Prediction 

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using several machine learning models. The models implemented include RandomForest Classifier, MLP Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC, SGD Classifier, and Logistic Regression. This project has also implemented data visualization. 

Project Description 
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on several chemical features such as acidity, chlorides, pH, and alcohol content. By leveraging multiple classification algorithms, this project compares the performance of each model in accurately predicting wine quality, which is categorized into two groups: good or bad

Features 
Predicts wine quality using six different machine learning classifiers.
Provides performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.
Handles preprocessing tasks such as scaling and train-test splitting.
